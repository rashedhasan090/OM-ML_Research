Exp 10 Jan23 - Regular Dataset  - Tokenization 5 - 7 OM Dataset


Notes
Optimizers used: 'Adadelta', 'Adagrad', 'Adam', ‘SGD’, ‘RMSProp’


Tokenization structure:

- statement specific tokenization, full completed statements from the dataset appeared in vocabulary.
Noticed separated sections (OM / Mapping / Schema) and also conjoint in few cases.
- Tokenization specified appended label with the target context instead of marking or considering the label as a
separate token
- No space based split due to tokenization on context or target
- numbers were stripped from the context and then it was considered
- Tokenization specified appended label with the target context instead of marking or considering the label as a
separate token
- Labels are not considered separately but along with subsections

- tokenization process is sequential and well organized

Ran multiple times to observe translations



- Run 1 : Adam (Sample 1 - 10) val steps=40, epochs 100
- Run 2 : Adadelta (Sample 11 - 20) val steps=40, epochs 100
- Run 3 : Adagrad(Sample 21 - 30) val steps=40, epochs 100
- Run 4 : SGD(Sample 31 - 40) val steps=40, epochs 100
- Run 5 : RMSProp (Sample 41 - 50) val steps=40, epochs 100

- Run 6 : Adam (Sample 51 - 60) val steps=40, epochs 100

- Run 7 : Adam (Sample 61 - 101) val steps=40, epochs 100 (consistent result with P and NP sos did not changed the optimizer)







---------------------------



Total Instance = 101

Pareto = 15
Not Pareto = 86


correctly predicted P = 3 (TP)
Incorrectly predicted P = 12 (FN)


correctly predicted NP = 86 (TN)
Incorrectly predicted NP = 0 (FP)

Incorrectly predicted = 12 predicted as NP but they were P | 3 predicted as P and they are P
0 predicted as P but they were NP | 86 predicted as NP and they are NP





Precision - TP / (TP + FP) = 3 / (3 + 0) = 3 / 3 = 1
Recall - TP / (TP + FN) = 3 / (3 + 12) = 0.2
Accuracy = (TN + TP ) / (TN + FP + TP + FN ) = (86 + 3) / (86 + 0 + 3 + 12) = 0.881
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall / Precision + Recall) = 2 * (1 * 0.2/ 1 + 0.2) = 2 * (0.2 / 1.2) = 0.33333
