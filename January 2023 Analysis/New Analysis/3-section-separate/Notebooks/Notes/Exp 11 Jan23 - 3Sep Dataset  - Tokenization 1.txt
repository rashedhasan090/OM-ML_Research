Exp 11 Jan23 - 3 Sep Dataset  - Tokenization 1 - 6 OM Dataset


Notes
Optimizers used: 'Adadelta', 'Adagrad', 'Adam', ‘SGD’, ‘RMSProp’


Tokenization structure:

- Comma separated tokenization, section based separation noticed.
- entity separation noticed.
- Labels considered as a token on target
- Each section appeared as separated


Ran multiple times to observe translations



- Run 1 : Adam (Sample 1 - 20) val steps=40, epochs 100
- Run 2 : Adagrad (Sample 21 - 40) val steps=40, epochs 100
- Run 3 : Adadelta(Sample 41 - 60) val steps=40, epochs 100


- Run 4 : SGD (Sample 61 - 80) val steps=40, epochs 100
- Run 5 : RMSProp (Sample 81 - 100) val steps=40, epochs 100








Total Instance = 101

Pareto = 15
Not Pareto = 86


correctly predicted P =  4 (TP)
Incorrectly predicted P =  11 (FN)


correctly predicted NP = 49 (TN)
Incorrectly predicted NP =  37 (FP)

Incorrectly predicted = 11  predicted as NP but they were P | 4  predicted as P and they are P
37  predicted as P but they were NP | 49  predicted as NP and they are NP





Precision - TP / (TP + FP) = 4 / (4 + 37) = 0.097
Recall - TP / (TP + FN) = 4 / (4 + 11) = 0.26
Accuracy = (TN + TP ) / (TN + FP + TP + FN ) = (49 + 4) / (49 + 37 + 4 + 11) = 0.524
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall / Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.097 * 0.26 / 0.097 + 0.26) = 2 * (0.02522 / 0.357) = 0.0706
