The given program has a race condition because multiple threads are accessing and modifying the shared variable 'global' concurrently without any synchronization mechanism. This can lead to inconsistent and unpredictable results.

To fix the race condition and ensure atomicity, we can use a synchronization primitive such as a mutex or a semaphore. In this case, let's use a mutex to protect the critical section where the 'global' variable is accessed and modified.

Here's an updated version of the program with atomicity annotations and a mutex:


from threading import Thread, Lock

global_value = 0
maxint = 100
mutex = Lock()

def thread_function():
    global global_value

    while True:
        mutex.acquire()
        if global_value + numthreads > maxint:
            mutex.release()
            continue
        else:
            local = global_value
            global_value += 1
            mutex.release()

            assert global_value > local

# Number of threads to create
numthreads = 5

# Create and start the threads
threads = []
for _ in range(numthreads):
    thread = Thread(target=thread_function)
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to finish
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()




In this updated version, we introduced a mutex (Lock) to protect the critical section where the 'global' variable is accessed and modified. The mutex.acquire() and mutex.release() calls ensure that only one thread can access the critical section at a time, preventing race conditions.

The assertion assert global_value > local is maintained because the mutex guarantees that the 'global' variable is updated atomically, ensuring that each thread sees a consistent and incremented value.

The program also avoids arithmetic overflow by checking if global_value + numthreads > maxint before incrementing 'global_value'. If the sum would exceed 'maxint', the thread skips the increment and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

By using the mutex and the additional checks, we have addressed the race condition and ensured the program operates correctly without triggering arithmetic overflow.



In this Alloy model, we define a Thread signature representing each thread in the system. Each thread has local and global fields to track their respective local and global values.

The ThreadInvariant predicate ensures that the global value of each thread is always greater than its local value.

The NoRaceCondition predicate enforces the absence of race conditions by stating that for any two distinct threads t1 and t2, their global values must be different.

The Main predicate represents the main execution of the program. It specifies the number of threads, creates the threads, and defines the execution steps within an unbounded loop. The loop ensures that the condition t.global + numthreads <= maxint holds before executing the program steps.

Finally, the run Main for 10 command runs the model for 10 instances, checking if the specified constraints hold.

Note: Please adjust the values and constraints (such as numthreads and maxint) according to your specific requirements.
