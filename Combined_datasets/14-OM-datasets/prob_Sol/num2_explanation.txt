Certainly! Let's discuss the provided solution step by step.

The solution defines a class `BooleanFormula` that represents Boolean formulas and provides methods to transform them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). The transformation process consists of three main steps: applying De Morgan's laws, eliminating implications, and distributing conjunction.

1. **Applying De Morgan's Laws**: The `apply_demorgan` method recursively applies De Morgan's laws to eliminate negations. It checks if the formula is a negation (`¬`) and then applies the appropriate transformation based on the operator (`∧` or `∨`). The `_apply_demorgan_recursively` method is called recursively to traverse the formula and apply De Morgan's laws to all subformulas.

2. **Eliminating Implications**: The `eliminate_implication` method recursively eliminates implications using the definition `p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q`. It checks if the formula is an implication (`→`) and transforms it accordingly. The `_eliminate_implication_recursively` method is called recursively to traverse the formula and eliminate implications in all subformulas.

3. **Distributing Conjunction**: The `distribute_conjunction` method recursively distributes conjunction over disjunction using the distributive law `p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)`. It checks if the formula is a conjunction (`∧`) and distributes it over any adjacent disjunctions (`∨`). The `_distribute_conjunction_recursively` method is called recursively to traverse the formula and distribute conjunctions in all subformulas.

4. **Conversion to CNF**: After applying the above transformations, the `transform_to_cnf` method calls the `convert_to_cnf` method to obtain the final CNF representation of the formula. However, the `convert_to_cnf` method is not implemented in the provided code. It should be added to complete the transformation to CNF.

It's important to note that the code provided is incomplete since the `convert_to_cnf` method is missing. Implementing this method is necessary to complete the transformation to CNF and obtain the set of clauses as required in the problem statement.

Once we have the complete implementation, we can further discuss the correctness of the solution and its proof of preserving satisfiability.
