To construct an interpolant from a proof of unsatisfiability, we can follow the algorithm described in the Shankar 2009 Computing Surveys article. Here's an outline of the algorithm:

1. Partition the input clause set K into K1 and K2, where K1 contains the atoms of K1 and K2 contains the atoms of K2.

2. For each clause 𝛾 in the proof:
   a. Partition 𝛾 into 𝛾1 and 𝛾2, where atoms(𝛾2) is a subset of atoms(K2) and atoms(𝛾1) \ atoms(K2) is empty.
   b. Construct the interpolant 𝐼𝛾 such that K1 ⊗ ~𝛾1 ⊢ 𝐼𝛾 and K2 ⊗ 𝐼𝛾 ⊢ ~𝛾2, where ~𝛾1 represents the negations of formulas in 𝛾1.

3. The interpolant for the entire proof is the conjunction of all the individual interpolants: 𝐼 = 𝐼𝛾₁ ∧ 𝐼𝛾₂ ∧ ...

In the provided example, the input clause sets K1 and K2 are:
K1 = {a ∨ e[e], ¬a ∨ b[b], ¬a ∨ c[c]}
K2 = {¬b ∨ ¬c ∨ d[>], ¬d[>], ¬e[>]}

Applying the resolution steps, we can derive the following interpolants:

𝐼𝛾₁ = 𝛾₁₂ = e[e]
𝐼𝛾₂ = 𝛾₂₁ = b
𝐼𝛾₃ = 𝛾₃₁ = c
𝐼𝛾₄ = 𝛾₄₁ = (e ∧ ¬b)
𝐼𝛾₅ = 𝛾₅₁ = ((e ∧ ¬b) ∧ (e ∧ c))

Therefore, the final interpolant for the proof of unsatisfiability is:
𝐼 = (e[e] ∧ b ∧ c ∧ (e ∧ ¬b) ∧ (e ∧ c))

Note that the interpolant 𝐼 satisfies the properties mentioned in the Shankar article: K1 ⊗ 𝐼 ⊢ 𝐼𝛾 for clauses in K1, and K2 ⊗ 𝐼 ⊢ ~𝐼𝛾 for clauses in K2. Additionally, the atoms of 𝐼 are a subset of atoms(K1) \ atoms(K2).

You can use this algorithm as a guide to construct an interpolant from a Resolution proof in Alloy by defining predicates and facts to represent the clauses, partitioning, and the resolution steps.
