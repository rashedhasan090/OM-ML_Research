Sure! I'll provide a verification for each of the sorting algorithms you mentioned: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quicksort, Heapsort, and Mergesort. I'll also demonstrate that they produce ordered permutations of the input and that they are stable.

1. Bubble Sort:
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm iterates through the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Here's the verification:

- Output is an ordered permutation: Bubble Sort guarantees that after each pass, the largest element "bubbles" to the end of the list. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted in ascending order. Thus, the output is an ordered permutation of the input.
- Stability: Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them only if they are in the wrong order. Since the algorithm doesn't change the order of elements with equal values, it is stable.

2. Insertion Sort:
Insertion Sort works by iteratively inserting elements into their correct position within a sorted sublist. Here's the verification:

- Output is an ordered permutation: Insertion Sort builds a sorted sublist from left to right, gradually inserting each element into its proper position. The output is, therefore, an ordered permutation of the input.
- Stability: Insertion Sort compares elements and shifts them only if the current element is smaller. Since elements with equal values are not swapped, the algorithm is stable.

3. Quicksort:
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively partitions the input list into smaller sublists. Here's the verification:

- Output is an ordered permutation: Quicksort selects a pivot element, partitions the list around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sublists on either side of the pivot. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. Quicksort guarantees an ordered permutation of the input.
- Stability: Quicksort can be implemented in a way that maintains stability by using a stable partitioning scheme. By choosing a pivot that preserves the relative order of equal elements, the algorithm can be made stable.

4. Heapsort:
Heapsort uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. The algorithm consists of building a max-heap from the input array and repeatedly extracting the maximum element. Here's the verification:

- Output is an ordered permutation: Heapsort builds a max-heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element, placing it at the end of the list. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. Hence, the output is an ordered permutation of the input.
- Stability: Heapsort, as originally designed, is not stable because the reheap procedure doesn't explicitly preserve the relative order of equal elements. However, a stable version of Heapsort can be implemented by using an auxiliary index array that tracks the original positions of elements during sorting. By considering the original positions as a secondary key, stability can be achieved.

5. Mergesort:
Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input list into smaller sublists, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back into a single sorted list. Here's the verification:

- Output is an ordered permutation: Mergesort divides the list into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. Mergesort guarantees an ordered permutation of the input.
- Stability: Mergesort's merging step compares elements from two sorted sublists and places them into the final sorted list. In case of equal elements, Mergesort preserves the relative order, ensuring stability.

In conclusion, all of the mentioned sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quicksort, Heapsort
