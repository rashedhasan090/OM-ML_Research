### Mapping Extraction 

1. It contains the program om_sol_extract.exe file. 
2. It contains the solution files. 
3. The program takes input , the XML files (e.g. customer_order_sol_1.xml)
4. It extracts necessary information along with the mapping. 
5. If mapping changes based on different solution, it captures it dynamically. 
6. It would generate a file OM_Mapping_strategy_1.txt. 
7. The program would compute the mapping and immediately ask for next file to generate abstracts. 
8. The input should be given as OM_Mapping_strategy_1.txt and it would generate the abstract format immediately 
9. Which should be saved at OM_Mapping_strategy_abstract_1.txt file. 
10. The original python source file is also included in the folder.
