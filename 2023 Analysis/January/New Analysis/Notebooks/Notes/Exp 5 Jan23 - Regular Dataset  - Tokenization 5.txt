Exp 5 Jan23 - Regular Dataset  - Tokenization 5 - 6 OM combined


Notes
Optimizers used: 'Adam''Adadelta', 'Adagrad', 'Adam', ‘SGD’, ‘RMSProp’


- statement specific tokenization, full completed statements from the dataset appeared in vocabulary.
Noticed separated sections (OM / Mapping / Schema) and also conjoint in few cases.
- Tokenization specified appended label with the target context instead of marking or considering the label as a
separate token
- No space based split due to tokenization on context or target
- numbers were stripped from the context and then it was considered
- Tokenization specified appended label with the target context instead of marking or considering the label as a
separate token
- Labels are not considered separately but along with subsections

- tokenization process is sequential and well organized


Ran multiple times to observe translations

---------------------------



Total Instance = 101

Pareto = 15
Not Pareto = 86


correctly predicted P =  1 (TP)
Incorrectly predicted P = 14 (FN)


correctly predicted NP = 77 (TN)
Incorrectly predicted NP = 9 (FP)

Incorrectly predicted = 14 predicted as NP but they were P | 1 predicted as P and they are P
9 predicted as P but they were NP | 77 predicted as NP and they are NP





Precision - TP / (TP + FP) = 1 / (1 + 9) = 0.1
Recall - TP / (TP + FN) = 1 / (1 + 14) = 0.066
Accuracy = (TN + TP ) / (TN + FP + TP + FN ) = (1 + 77) / (77 + 9 + 1 + 14) = 0.77
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall / Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.1 * 0.066 / 0.1 + 0.066) = 2 * (0.0066 / 0.166) = 0.079
