Exp 5 Jan23 - Regular Dataset  - Tokenization 1 - 7 OM combined


Notes
Optimizers used: 'Adam''Adadelta', 'Adagrad', 'Adam', ‘SGD’, ‘RMSProp’


- Comma separated tokenization, section based separation noticed.
- entity separation noticed.
- Labels considered as a token on target

- Failed to receive results due to separation between entities


Ran multiple times to observe translations



- Run 1 : Adam (Sample 1 - 10) val steps=20, epochs 100 no result

- Run 2 : Adadelta (Sample 11 - 20) val steps=40, epochs 100 no result

correctly predicted P =   (TP)
Incorrectly predicted P =  (FN)


correctly predicted NP =  (TN)
Incorrectly predicted NP =  (FP)

Incorrectly predicted =  predicted as NP but they were |  predicted as  and they are
 predicted as P but they were NP |  predicted as NP and they are NP
